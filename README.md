# [Computer Science 11](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/mathematics/11/computer-science) 
Christopher Lin's work for [BC Curriculum - Computer Science 11](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/mathematics/11/computer-science).

The materials are selected from: 
- Harvard University's [CS50 - Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/)

### Notes:
- Being an on-campus college course at Harvard University, each CS50 module covers multiple CS11 topics at greater depth.
- The ordering of units is based on the ordering of [BC Curriculum]((https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/mathematics/11/computer-science)). However, it is recommended to be taught in the following order:
  - Unit 1, 2, Test 1
  - Unit 3, 4, Test 2
  - Unit 5, 7, Test 3
  - Unit 6, 8, Test 4
  - Unit 9
  - Final Exam    
- Possible **Course Project**:
  - [SWIFT Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/) 
  - ICS Science Fair with subject under Computer Science 
  
## Units
### 1. Ways to represent basic data types
- [number systems (e.g., binary, hexadecimal)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/)

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/0/) and [CS50 Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/1/)**



### 2. Basic Programming concepts 
- variables, constants, mathematical operations, input/output, generating random numbers

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/1/)**
#### Assignment: [CS50 Week1 Lab 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/1/) (For Units 1 and 2)


### 3. Variable Scope
- local versus global

**Topic covered in: [CS50 Week 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/shorts/variables_and_scope/)**

### 4. Ways to construct and evaluate logical statements
- logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, or <>)
- logical equivalences (e.g., De Morgan’s laws), simplification of logical statements, truth tables

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/1/)**
#### Assignment: [CS50 Week 1 Problem Set 1 - Mario (more)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/1/mario/more/) (For Units 3 and 4)



### 5. Use of control flow to manipulate program execution
- decision structures (e.g., if-then-else)
- loops (e.g., for, while, nested loops)

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/1/)**
#### Assignment: [CS50 Week 1 Problem Set 1 - Cash](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/1/cash/)



### 6. Development of algorithms
- step-wise refinement, pseudocode or flowcharts, translating between pseudocode and code and vice versa

**Topic covered in Course Project**
#### Assignment: **Course Project**

### 7. Techniques for operations on and searching of arrays and lists
- append, remove, insert, delete
- searching algorithms (e.g., linear and binary searches)

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/2/) and first part of [CS50 Week 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/3/)**

### 8. Problem decomposition through modularity
- use of methods/functions to reduce complexity, reuse code, and use function parameters
- return values

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/shorts/functions/)**
#### Assignment: [CS50 Week 3 Problem Set 3 - Plurality](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/3/plurality/) (For Units 7 and 8)

### 9. Uses of computing for financial analysis
- time value of money, appreciation/depreciation, mortgage amortization
- modify the variables of a financial scenario to run a “what-if” analysis on them (e.g., compare different monthly payments, term lengths, interest rates)
#### Assignment: Using [Jupyter Notebook on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code) to create an interactive amortization schedule
