# [Computer Science 11](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/mathematics/11/computer-science) 
Christopher Lin's work for [BC Curriculum - Computer Science 11](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/mathematics/11/computer-science).

The materials are selected from: 
- Harvard University's [CS50 - Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/)

### TODO:
- Select assignments/problems for each topic
- More details on description and subtopic of each CS50 Week's material, since not a 1-to-1 map from CS50's modules to CS11 topics.
- Include other projects, such as [SWIFT Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/) or Science Fair
  
## Topics
### 1. Ways to represent basic data types
- [number systems (e.g., binary, hexadecimal)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/)
- [strings, integers, characters, floating point](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/shorts/data_types/)

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/0/) and [CS50 Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/1/)**
#### Assignment:
- [CS50 Week1 Lab 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/1/)


### 2. Basic Programming concepts 
- variables, constants, mathematical operations, input/output, generating random numbers

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/1/)**


### 3. Variable Scope
- local versus global

**Topic covered in: TBD**

### 4. Ways to construct and evaluate logical statements
- logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- relational operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, or <>)
- logical equivalences (e.g., De Morgan’s laws), simplification of logical statements, truth tables

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/1/)**
### 5. Use of control flow to manipulate program execution
- decision structures (e.g., if-then-else)
- loops (e.g., for, while, nested loops)

#### Assignment:
- [CS50 Week 1 Problem Set 1 - Cash](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/1/cash/)

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/1/)**

### 6. Development of algorithms
- step-wise refinement, pseudocode or flowcharts, translating between pseudocode and code and vice versa

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/)**

### 7. Techniques for operations on and searching of arrays and lists
- append, remove, insert, delete
- searching algorithms (e.g., linear and binary searches)

**Topic covered in [CS50 Week 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/2/) and [CS50 Week 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/3/)**

### 8. Problem decomposition through modularity
- use of methods/functions to reduce complexity, reuse code, and use function parameters
- return values

**Topic covered in TBD**

### 9. Uses of computing for financial analysis
- time value of money, appreciation/depreciation, mortgage amortization
- modify the variables of a financial scenario to run a “what-if” analysis on them (e.g., compare different monthly payments, term lengths, interest rates)
