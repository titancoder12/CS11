Test: Computer Science 11 - C Programming. Unit 3, 4

Duration: 1 hour

Section 1: Local versus Global Variables (10 marks)

1.1 Define what a local variable is in C and provide an example.

1.2 Explain the difference between a local variable and a global variable.

1.3 Write a C program that demonstrates the use of both local and global variables.

1.4 Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using local variables.

Section 2: Logical Operators (15 marks)

2.1 Explain the purpose of the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT in C.

2.2 Write a C program that uses logical AND to determine if a number is both even and positive.

2.3 Write a C program that uses logical OR to check if a number is divisible by either 3 or 5.

2.4 What is short-circuit evaluation, and how does it relate to logical operators?

2.5 Provide an example of using the logical NOT operator in a C program.

Section 3: Relational Operators (15 marks)

3.1 List and explain the relational operators in C.

3.2 Write a C program that compares two integers using all the relational operators.

3.3 Explain the difference between the == and = operators in C.

3.4 How are relational operators used in decision-making structures such as if statements?

3.5 Write a C program that uses relational operators to compare two floating-point numbers.

Section 4: Logical Equivalences and De Morgan's Laws (10 marks)

4.1 State De Morgan's Laws and provide an example of their application in C.

4.2 Explain the concept of logical equivalence in C programming.

4.3 Write a C program that demonstrates the logical equivalence of two expressions.

4.4 How can De Morgan's Laws be useful in simplifying logical expressions?

Section 5: Simplification of Logical Statements (15 marks)

5.1 Write a C program that evaluates the logical expression (A AND B) OR (C AND NOT D).

5.2 Simplify the logical expression ((P AND Q) OR (NOT P)) AND (P OR R).

5.3 How can Karnaugh maps be used to simplify logical expressions?

5.4 Write a C program that uses a simplified logical expression to make a decision.

Section 6: Truth Tables (15 marks)

6.1 Define a truth table and explain its use in logic.

6.2 Create a truth table for the logical expression (A OR B) AND (NOT C).

6.3 How can truth tables assist in testing the validity of logical expressions?

6.4 Write a C program that prints a truth table for a given logical expression.
