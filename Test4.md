Test: Computer Science 11 - C Programming

Duration: 1 hour

Section 1: Step-Wise Refinement and Problem Solving (15 marks)

1.1 Define step-wise refinement and explain its role in problem-solving.

1.2 Write a C program that uses step-wise refinement to solve a simple problem (e.g., calculate the factorial of a number).

1.3 Discuss the advantages of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable tasks.

1.4 How does step-wise refinement contribute to code readability and maintainability?

Section 2: Pseudocode or Flowcharts (15 marks)

2.1 Define pseudocode and explain its use in algorithm development.

2.2 Provide an example of a pseudocode algorithm for finding the maximum element in an array.

2.3 Compare and contrast pseudocode and flowcharts in terms of expressing algorithms.

2.4 Write a C program based on a given pseudocode algorithm.

2.5 How can using pseudocode or flowcharts benefit collaboration among programmers?

Section 3: Translating Between Pseudocode and Code (20 marks)

3.1 Translate the following pseudocode into C code:
```
Algorithm: CalculateSquare
Input: a number
Output: the square of the number
Begin
   Read the number
   Square the number
   Print the result
End
```
3.2 Given the C code snippet:
```
int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 7;
    // Add pseudocode comments explaining the code's purpose
    int result = x + y;
    return 0;
}
```
Write the corresponding pseudocode for the code.
3.3 Discuss the challenges and benefits of translating between pseudocode and code.

Section 4: Use of Functions to Reduce Complexity and Reuse Code (20 marks)

4.1 Explain the importance of using functions/methods to reduce code complexity.

4.2 Write a C program that uses a function to calculate the average of an array of numbers.

4.3 Discuss how the use of functions promotes code reuse.

4.4 Provide an example of a situation where creating a function would be beneficial.

4.5 How does using functions enhance code modularity and maintainability?

Section 5: Use of Function Parameters and Return Values (20 marks)

5.1 Explain the concept of function parameters in C.

5.2 Write a C program that uses a function with parameters to swap the values of two variables.

5.3 Discuss the importance of return values in functions.

5.4 Provide an example of a C program that utilizes a function with a return value.

5.5 How can the use of parameters and return values contribute to efficient code?
